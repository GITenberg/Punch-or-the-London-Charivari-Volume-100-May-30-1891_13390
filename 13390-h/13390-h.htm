    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Condensed and Revised Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless
    Ibsenite.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. IV.&mdash;THE WILD DUCK.</h3>

    <h4>ACT III.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>HIALMAR's <i>Studio. A photograph has just been
        taken</i>, GINA <i>and</i> HEDVIG <i>are tidying
        up.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gina</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). There <i>should</i>
    have been a luncheon-party in this Act, with Dr. RELLING and
    MÖLVIK, who would have been in a state of comic "chippiness,"
    after his excesses overnight. But, as it hadn't much to do with
    such plot as there is, we cut it out. It came cheaper. Here
    comes your father back from his walk with that lunatic, Young
    WERLE&mdash;you had better go and play with the Wild Duck.
    [HEDVIG <i>goes</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>coming in</i>). I have been for a walk
    with GREGERS; he meant well&mdash;but it was tiring. GINA, he
    has told me that, fifteen years ago, before I married you, you
    were rather a Wild Duck, so to speak. (<i>Severely.</i>) Why
    haven't you been writhing in penitence and remorse all these
    years, eh?</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/253.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/253.png"
             alt="Hedvig with the pistol." /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Gina</i> (<i>sensibly</i>). Why? Because I have had other
    things to do. <i>You</i> wouldn't take any photographs, so I
    <i>had</i> to.</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. All the same&mdash;it was a swamp of deceit.
    And where am I to find elasticity of spirit to bring out my
    grand invention now? I used to shut myself up in the parlour,
    and ponder and cry, when I thought that the effort of inventing
    anything would sap my vitality. (<i>Pathetically.</i>) I
    <i>did</i> want to leave you an inventor's widow; but I never
    shall now, particularly as I haven't made up my mind what to
    invent yet. Yes, it's all over. Rabbits are trash, and even
    poultry palls. And I'll wring that cursed Wild Duck's neck!</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>coming in beaming</i>). Well, so you've
    got it over. <i>Wasn't</i> it soothing and ennobling, eh? and
    <i>ain't</i> you both obliged to me?</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i>. No; it's my opinion you'd better have minded
    your own business, [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>in great surprise</i>). Bless me! Pardon
    my Norwegian <i>naïveté</i> but this ought really to be quite a
    new starting-point. Why, I confidently expected to have found
    you both beaming!&mdash;Mrs. EKDAL, being so illiterate, may
    take some little time to see it&mdash;but you, HIALMAR, with
    your deep mind, surely <i>you</i> feel a new consecration,
    eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes. I
    suppose so&mdash;in a sort of way.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[HEDVIG <i>runs in, overjoyed.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i>. Father, only see what Mrs. SÖRBY has given,
    me for a birthday present&mdash;a beautiful deed of gift!
    [<i>Shows it.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>eluding her</i>). Ha! Mrs. SÖRBY, the
    family Housekeeper. My father's sight failing! HEDVIG in
    goggles! What vistas of heredity these astonishing coincidences
    open up! <i>I</i> am not short-sighted, at all events, and I
    see it all&mdash;all! <i>This</i> is my answer. (<i>He takes
    the deed, and tears it across.</i>) Now I have nothing more to
    do in this house. (<i>Puts on overcoat.</i>) My home has fallen
    in ruins about me. (<i>Bursts into tears.</i>) My hat!</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. Oh, but you <i>mustn't</i> go. You must be
    all three together, to attain the true frame of mind for
    self-sacrificing forgiveness, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. Self-sacrificing forgiveness be blowed!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He tears himself away, and goes out.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i> (<i>with despairing eyes</i>). Oh, he said it
    might be blowed! Now he'll <i>never</i> come home any more!</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. Shall I tell you how to regain your father's
    confidence, and bring him home surely? Sacrifice the Wild
    Duck.</p>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i>. Do you think that will do any good?</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. You just <i>try</i> it! [<i>Curtain.</i></p>

    <h4>ACT IV.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Same Scene</i>. GREGERS <i>enters, and finds</i> GINA
        <i>retouching photographs</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). HIALMAR not come in yet,
    after last night, I suppose?</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i>. Not he! He's been out on the loose all night
    with RELLING and MÖLVIK. Now he's snoring on their sofa.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>disappointed.</i>)
    Dear!&mdash;dear!&mdash;when he ought to be yearning to wrestle
    in solitude and self-examination!</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i> (<i>rudely</i>). Self-examine your
    grandmother!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She goes out</i>; HEDVIG <i>comes in.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>to Hedvig</i>). Ah, I see you haven't
    found courage to settle the Wild Duck yet!</p>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i>. No&mdash;it seemed such a delightful idea at
    first. Now it strikes me as a trifle&mdash;well,
    <i>Ibsenish</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>reprovingly</i>). I <i>thought</i> you
    hadn't grown up quite unharmed in this house! But if you really
    had the true, joyous spirit of self-sacrifice, you'd have a
    shot at that Wild Duck, if you died for it!</p>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i> (<i>slowly</i>). I see; you mean that my
    constitution's changing, and I ought to behave as such?</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. Exactly, I'm what Americans would term a
    "crank"&mdash;but <i>I</i> believe in you, HEDVIG.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[HEDVIG <i>takes down the pistol from the mantelpiece,
        and goes into the garret with flashing eyes;</i> GINA
        <i>comes in.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>looking in at door with hesitation; he is
    unwashed and dishevelled</i>). Has anybody happened to see my
    hat?</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i>. Gracious, what a sight you are! Sit down and
    have some breakfast, do. [<i>She brings it.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). What! touch food under
    <i>this</i> roof? Never! (<i>Helps himself to bread-and-butter
    and coffee.</i>) Go and pack up my scientific uncut books, my
    manuscripts, and all the best rabbits, in my portmanteau. I am
    going away for ever. On second thoughts, I shall stay in the
    spare room for another day or two&mdash;it won't be the same as
    living with you!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He takes some salt meat.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. <i>Must</i> you go? Just when you've got
    nice firm ground to build upon&mdash;thanks to me! Then there's
    your great invention, too.</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. Everything's invented already. And I only
    cared about my invention because, although it doesn't exist
    yet, I thought HEDVIG believed in it, with all the strength of
    her sweet little shortsighted eyes! But now I don't believe in
    HEDVIG!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He pours himself out another cup of coffee.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). But, HIALMAR, if I can
    prove to you that she is ready to sacrifice her cherished Wild
    Duck? See!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He pushes back sliding-door, and discovers</i>
        HEDVIG <i>aiming at the</i> Wild Duck <i>with the butt-end
        of the pistol. Tableau.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gina</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). But don't you <i>see</i>?
    It's the pigstol&mdash;that fatal Norwegian weapon which, in
    Ibsenian dramas, <i>never</i> shoots straight! And she has got
    it by the wrong end too. She will shoot herself!</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>quietly</i>). She will! Let the child
    make amends. It will be a most realistic and impressive
    finale!</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i>. No, no&mdash;put down the pigstol,
    HEDVIG. Do you hear, child?</p>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i> (<i>still aiming</i>). I hear&mdash;but I
    shan't unless father tells me to.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. HIALMAR, show the great soul I always
    <i>said</i> you had. This sorrow will set free what is noble in
    you. Don't spoil a fine situation. Be a man! Let the child
    shoot herself!</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>irresolutely</i>). Well, really I don't
    know. There's a good deal in what GREGERS says. Hm!</p>

    <p><i>Gina</i>. A good deal of tomfool rubbish! I'm illiterate,
    I know. I've been a Wild Duck in my time, and I waddle. But for
    all that, I'm the only person in the play with a grain of
    common-sense. And I'm sure&mdash;whatever Mr. IBSEN or GREGERS
    choose to say&mdash;that a screaming burlesque like this ought
    <i>not</i> to end like a tragedy&mdash;even in this queer
    Norway of ours! And it shan't, either! Tell the child to put
    that nasty pigstol down and come away, do!</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>yielding</i>). Ah, well, I am a farcical
    character myself, after all. Don't touch a hair of that duck's
    head, HEDVIG. Come to my arms and all shall be forgiven!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[HEDVIG <i>throws down the pistol,&mdash;which goes off
        and kills a rabbit&mdash;and rushes into her father's
        arms</i>. Old EKDAL <i>comes out of a corner with a fowl on
        each shoulder, and bursts into tears. Affecting family
        picture.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). It's all very pretty, I
    dare say&mdash;but it's not IBSEN! My real mission is to be the
    thirteenth at table. I don't know what I mean&mdash;but I fly
    to fulfil it! [<i>He goes.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. And now we've got rid of <i>him</i>, HEDVIG,
    fetch me the deed of gift I tore up, and a slip of paper, and a
    penny bottle of gum, and we'll soon make a valid instrument of
    it again!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He pastes the torn deed together as the Curtain
        slowly descends.</i></p>

        <p>[Sir RICHARD QUAIN (seconding the proposal of Lord

    <h2>OUR PARTICULAR TIP FOR THE DERBY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Furnished by the Odd Man Out.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Looking through the List of Probable Starters (who are all
    coming on well, and might therefore be called, in the quaint
    turf Italian, "<i>comeystarters</i>"), I cannot help feeling
    that this year the Blue Riband of the Turf will fall to the
    flower of the flock&mdash;as, indeed, it should. But if it does
    not, why, there are other really sound horses that are sure to
    give a good account of themselves. We may take it, that the
    winner will be out of the common. As the glorious animal passes
    the post, the cheers will be so deafening, that there will be a
    universal cry, "This must be ordinance!" As the fun of the
    Derby of late times has seen some revival, the hero of the hour
    will, <i>par excellence</i>, be the doll, which, in spite of
    many rivals, has never ceased to be popular. Not that the fun
    will be fast and furious&mdash;not at all; the days of the
    Mohawks are over, and I am, therefore, in a position to
    declare, that the day when it is past and gone, will be
    appropriately called a dorcas meeting. And this I can say with
    the less hesitation as I rely on the power of a deemster. To
    everyone the occasion will be pleasant, both to wise men and
    persons of a simple sort; to adopt the words of the historical
    Pieman, "for this meeting fits Simon." And here let me remark,
    that I am an enthusiastic admirer of the perambulating
    gentleman who outwitted the pastie purchaser; in fact, "I go
    solid for the Simonian." If the field is dusty on the morning
    of the race, it will be following precedent. When I think of
    the Derby, I cannot help remembering HENRY THE EIGHTH, for it
    was to hold the Field of the Cloth of Gold that that eminent
    monarch had to raise the dust. Well might FRANÇOIS PREMIER have
    observed (as I do), "<i>Bravo, Gouverneur!"</i> If DICKENS's
    naval hero, the Captain whose words were always worth "making a
    note of," were to use the belt of Orion as a support in a sea
    of trouble, I should applaud his wisdom. In fact, I should
    observe, that the occasion was worthy of the Cuttle's tone. And
    now to come to business. For after all, what I have written
    above is merely a hint to those who require no telling. A
    prophet to be believed must be mysterious. But that the
    simplest understanding may comprehend, I give my final tip.
    Here it is. This year's Derby will be won by one of two. It
    will either fall to the Favourite or&mdash;the Field!</p>

    <h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May</i> 19.&mdash;With pleasant recollections of
    MARIE ROZE and BARTON McGUCKIN, and, as I think, a Mr. SCOBELL
    playing the swaggering relative, I went to see <i>Manon</i>, at
    Covent Garden, Miss SIBYL SANDERSON being the Heroine, and M.
    VAN DYCK the Hero.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/256-1.png"><img width="100%"

        </a><i>M. Van Dyck des Grieux et Mlle. Manon Sanderson.</i>
    </div>

    <p>(<i>Ensemble.</i>) "Nous irons au Guildhall!"</p>

    <p><i>M. Van D.</i> "Voilà la voiture du Lor' Maire, grace à M.
    Le Sheriff Druriolanus."</p>

    <p><i>Manon</i>. "Comme il est gentil! Je n'attendais qu'un
    '<i>Van</i>.'"]</p>

    <p>The new <i>prima donna</i> has everything in her favour, and
    very soon she was in favour with the audience, but not in such
    high favour as was the tenor with the artistic name, who,
    fairly taking the audience by assault, constituted himself,
    <i>pro tem.</i>, the man in possession of the ear of the House.
    He is a success; as a young master bearing the name of so
    distinguished an Old Master should be. [<i>Query</i>, would it
    be rude to say to a really good Van Dyck, "You go and be hung!"
    Perhaps the learned Editor of <i>Musical Notes and Queries</i>
    will reply. Of course much depends on the frame.] As for the
    new soprano SIBYL&mdash;more power to her organ! Her acting was
    good, but not great, and what ought to be her song <i>par
    excellence</i> went for nothing, or, at least, it could have
    been bought very cheap. There is far more dialogue in
    <i>Manon</i> than a Covent Garden audience is accustomed to,
    and this superfluity is resented by those who come for the
    singing, and who, if any talking is to be done, like to do it
    themselves. The three young ladies who go about together as a
    perpetual trio, suggest the notion of a light and airy version,
    feminine gender, of the three Anabaptists in the
    <i>Prophète</i>. M. ISNARDON as <i>Des Grieux, père</i>, a
    character that might be operatically nearly related to
    <i>Germont, père</i>, in <i>La Traviata</i>, was impressively
    dramatic, but decidedly disappointing in his one great song,
    which ought to be a certain <i>encore</i>. It may be true that
    an opera intended for a small stage does not stand a fair
    chance of success on a large one, and <i>vice versâ</i>, as no
    doubt the LORD MAYOR's coach provided by DRURIOLANUS SHERIFFUS
    for the occasion would look absurd on the stage of the Opéra
    Comique, while here when it comes round to the gate to fetch
    <i>Des Grieux</i>, it creates as great a sensation as ever it
    would do in the Strand on the Ninth of November, even with the
    Sheriff inside it.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Speaking as an opera-goer of some
    thirty years' sitting, I am inclined to assert that the
    performance last Wednesday of <i>Les Huguenots</i> beats the
    record, as will be allowed by all whose memory runneth not to
    the contrary, "nevertheless" and "notwithstanding" being
    included. Except MARIO, as <i>Raoul</i>, and some add, except
    DORUS GRAS as the Queen, never was seen and heard so fine a
    performance as is this to-night; and this deponent witnesseth
    that no such <i>ensemble</i> has ever been seen for this really
    grand Opera. Strange to hear sweet little <i>Manon</i> one
    night, and the next these overpowering <i>Huguenots</i>. It is
    well worth the while, in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages, to record
    this exceptionally brilliant cast. First, Madame ALBANI for the
    heroine <i>Valentina</i>, superb alike in singing and in
    acting; GIULIA RAVOGLI as <i>Urbano</i>, the page, a memorable
    page in operatic history; <i>Conte di San Bris</i>, by M.
    LASSALLE, not to be bettered, as may be also said of Signor
    MIRANDA (by kind permission of SHAKSPEARE's <i>Tempest</i>,
    probably a descendant) as <i>De Retz</i>, afterwards converted,
    and appearing as <i>Il Padre Basso</i>, Superior of a
    Theatrical Order, one of the exceptional Orders admitted after
    seven. Then M. MAUREL, with his highly <i>Maurel</i> tone,
    cannot be beaten as the high-minded <i>Conte de Nevers</i>; and
    EDOUARD DE RESZKÉ, taken altogether&mdash;and there's a lot of
    him&mdash;is quite the best <i>Marcello</i> that has been heard
    and seen for some considerable time. Herr FORMES and MABINI
    were the rugged Huguenot soldier to the life, but they weren't
    the Harmonious Blacksmith that NED DE RESZKÉ is. JEAN DE RESZKÉ
    methinks lacketh impassioned tenderness in the great duet
    scene, where ALBANI is inimitable; otherwise JEAN is a gallant
    <i>Raoul</i>. <i>Ensemble</i> as already said, which term
    includes chorus, <i>mise-en-scène</i>, and orchestra under the
    energetic rule of Signor BEVIGNANI, simply perfect. Those who
    this season miss seeing <i>Les Huguenots</i> with this
    unexampled cast, will be justly upbraided by their children and
    grandchildren. Mr. COVENT-GARDENIA HALL with the Gladstone
    flower in his button-hole, almost weeps to think that his
    much-loved leader is unable to come from Dollis Hill and bestow
    his liberal praise upon <i>Les Huguenots</i>. DRURIOLANUS may
    well beam upon the crammed house, viewing a portion of it with
    his nose over the ledge of the stall gangway portal; well may
    he smile, hum the melodies to himself (what better audience can
    he have for the performance!) expand in full bloom and speak
    joyously out of the very fulness of his heart and pocket; nay,
    for the moment he may even look upon the sheriffship and all
    its glory as a mere vanity of vanities, in comparison with the
    proud position of being DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS MAGNIFICISSIMUS,
    who has given opera-goers this new and rare edition of <i>Les
    Huguenots</i>. The gloved hand and the lorgnette of H.R.H. are
    visible in the omnibus-box, where our music-loving Prince is
    happily congratulating himself on another little FIFE being
    added to the harmonious Royal Band, while the loyal public is
    mightily pleased thus to have it proved to ocular
    demonstration, that the subtle villain, Influenza, has been
    baulked in his traitorous attempt on the Royal Personage, and
    they sincerely hope that the insidious poisoner, being thus
    arrested in his course, may, with all his treacherous
    <i>bacilli</i>, be for ever banished this happy and generally
    healthy realm.</p>

    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It was CODLINGSBY JUNIOR, who saved the Vraibleusian Party
    after the battle of Bahborough. By sending a stern and
    <i>staccato</i> epistle to the "Jupiter Tonans"; by praising
    (and imitating) Colonel DE CAUCUSINE, the real inspiring spirit
    in the camp of the victorious GRANDOLMAN, the march of the
    Hubbabub army was stopped&mdash;the menaced empire of
    Vraibleusia was saved from the flowing tide of Radical ruin;
    the Marquis of STROKEFOGIES appeared in a blaze of triumph that
    outblazed even the Berlin "Peace with Honour" business, and
    CODLINGSBY JUNIOR "took the cake."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The dinner over, the young men rushed from their Club
    (White's), flushed, full fed, and eager for battle. If the
    Blues were angry, the Buffs were also on the alert.</p>

    <p>"I can have a dinner at any hour," said CODLINGSBY JUNIOR;
    "but a Blue and Buff row"&mdash;(a shillelagh here flying
    through the window crashed "the cake" from CODLINGSBY's
    hand)&mdash;"a Blue and Buff row is a novelty to me. The Buffs
    have the best of it, clearly, though; the Cads outnumber the
    Swells. Ha! a good blow! How that burly Caucusite went down
    before yonder slim young fellow in the primrose pants!"</p>

    <p>"That is the Lord TIDDLEMPOPS," said a companion. "A light
    weight, but a pretty fighter," CODLINGSBY remarked. "Well hit
    with your left, Lord TIDDLEMPOPS; well parried, Lord
    TIDDLEMPOPS; claret drawn, by Jingo!"</p>

    <p>"He never can be going to match himself against that
    Wirepuller!" CODLINGSBY exclaimed, as an enormous
    Caucusite&mdash;no other than SCHNADDY, indeed, the famous
    ex-Brummagem bruiser, before whose fists the Blues went down
    like ninepins&mdash;fought his way up to the spot where,
    pluckily, but a little too negligently, TIDDLEMPOPS and one or
    two of his young friends were bringing aristocratic <i>laissez
    faire</i> to bear against the <i>fortiter in re</i> of the
    fighting Caucusite Cads.</p>

    <p>The young noble faced the huge champion with the languid
    gallantry of his race, but was no match for the enemy's brawn
    and biceps, and went down in every round. His organisation, in
    fact, though fine, was not sufficiently firm and well-knit to
    face the sinewy and skilful SCHNADDY. The brutal fellow, who
    meant business, had no mercy on the lad, who meant larks. His
    savage treatment chafed CODLINGSBY JUNIOR, as he viewed the
    unequal combat from White's window.</p>

    <p>"Hold your hand!" he cried to the Goliath. "Don't you see
    he's but a novice?"</p>

    <p>"Down he goes again!" the wiry Wirepuller cried, not heeding
    the interruption. "Down he goes again! I like whopping a
    swell!"</p>

    <p>"Coward!" shouted CODLINGSBY. "The sight makes me feel quite
    Dizzy. A CODLINGSBY to the rescue!" and to fling open the
    window, amidst a shower of malodorous missiles, to vault over
    the balcony, and slide down one of the pillars to the ground,
    baring his steely biceps in the process, and shying the
    "castor" from his curly looks with all the virile grace of the
    Great Earl, was the work of exactly five-sixths of a
    second.</p>

    <p>At the sixth-sixth he stood before the enormous
    Wirepuller.</p>

    <p>"SCHNADDY, my boy," he exclaimed, "I'm going to fight you
    with your own weapon&mdash;and wallop you. Look to yourself,
    churl Caucusite!"</p>

    <p>"DIZZY's <i>Double, by all that's theosophical!</i>"
    faltered SCHNADDY, shrinking at once to half his previous size,
    under the influence of the startling sight, and the yet more
    startling "spank" from young DIZZY's dexter bunch-of-fives.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When SCHNADDY, after six weeks' bed and bandaging, at last
    came out of hospital, his occupation as Wirepuller was gone.
    CODLINGSBY JUNIOR had stepped into his shoes, and the late
    "Organiser of Victory" and his Party had not "the least little
    bit of a look in."</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Baron's Assistant Reader has been dipping into <i>Robert
    Browning&mdash;Essays and Thoughts</i>, by JOHN T. NETTLESHIP.
    (ELKIN MATHEWS, Vigo Street.) He advises all other readers to
    grasp his nettleship boldly. At last the Baron's A.R. thinks he
    understands "Childe Roland," after reading the twenty-five
    pages which Mr. NETTLESHIP devotes to the explanation of this
    noble but tantalising poem. Mr. NETTLESHIP's attitude is that
    of a fervent, but humble disciple, for whom his Master's every
    word possesses deep and subtle meanings. He believes with
    GEORGE ELIOT that "the words of genius bear a wider meaning
    than the thought which prompted them." That of course gives him
    unlimited scope, and sometimes makes the explanations long; but
    every lover of BROWNING will find in the book a great deal of
    sound and helpful criticism well expressed. Buy the book and
    see for yourself, says the Baron's A.R.</p>

             alt="The Art of Lying." /></a>The Art of Lying.
    </div>

    <p>Fascinating is OSCAR WILDE's paper "On the Decay of Lying,"
    which is the first essay in a book of his entitled
    <i>Intentions</i>. If it be true that the art of lying is
    decaying&mdash;but, stay! how can anyone take the word of a
    professor of the art of lying for this or any other fact? No,
    his motto must be, "See me reverse." Not that by suggesting
    this motto I would for a moment be understood as expressing a
    wish for OSCAR's once again dropping into poetry&mdash;that
    OSCAR should once again take to the other sort of Lyre; far
    from it. No; let him remain the head professor of the gay
    science of mendacity in the Cretan College. Now, when a
    Professor and double M.A., <i>i.e.</i>, Master of the
    Mendacious Art in the Cretan College, says or writes one thing,
    he must be taken as meaning exactly the opposite. Otherwise he
    is no Cretan, and must be degraded from his Professorship.
    Bearing this in mind, the essay is, as I have said, in matter
    most amusing, and in style charming. Remember, my reader, that
    whosoever and whatsoever is blamed, abused, or flouted in this
    essay, is really being praised, lauded, and adulated to the
    skies by the Cretan critic. But when the M.M.A. writes on other
    subjects, are we to trust him? there's the difficulty. So after
    the first essay, which is hereby recommended by the Faculty,
    the Baron puts the book aside. "<i>Caute legendum</i>,"

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>May 13th.</i>&mdash;Expenses keep mounting up. On
    Saturday received a letter from BLISSOP (Secretary of the
    Association), stating that it was deemed necessary to take a
    new Committee-room in Main Street, and asking me if they might
    draw on me for the cost of furnishing it, a matter of about
    £15. Replied that I must take time to consider whether such
    expenditure was proper. Three more charitable institutions
    claim me as an annual subscriber, and the Billsbury Free
    Hospital Committee have informed me that CHUBSON always gives
    them £10 a year. Have had to do ditto.</p>

    <p><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;Had an extraordinary letter from
    VULLIAMY this morning. He is staying at Billsbury&mdash;but the
    letter explains itself. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>MY DEAR PATTLE, (<i>Confidential.</i>)</p>

        <p>I am asked to let you know that a Committee Meeting has
        been called for Friday 16th, and it is hoped that, at all
        costs, you will make it convenient to attend. You know how
        great an interest I have always taken in your career. I
        have always told you that any experience I may have gained
        in electioneering matters (and I have been at it for about
        twenty years now) is entirely at your service. You will
        therefore forgive me if I speak quite frankly to you on
        some questions which intimately concern your Candidature. I
        don't meet you as often as I should wish, and I am
        therefore impelled to write to you on matters which require
        your serious consideration, and on which you ought to be
        prepared to make a definite statement on Friday next. I
        have used the opportunity of my stay here to see how the
        land lay with regard to you. Hitherto you have done very
        well, but mere public meetings will not win an election,
        and you must make up your mind ere very long to come and
        stay here, so as to canvass each ward, under the guidance
        of the proper "officers."</p>

        <p>Then there is the question of money! The Registration
        <i>must</i> he paid for by the Candidate. It will be heavy
        this year. You can talk it over with the Committee, but
        certainly £100 to £150 will be absolutely necessary.
        Whatever the sum is, you must be prepared to pay it. I
        trust you will excuse my being candid with you, both for
        your own sake and the Party's. If £200 or £300 more or less
        is any object to you, and if you (<i>or your friends</i>)
        are not prepared to do certain things, such as bringing up
        voters, &amp;c., it is useless your hoping to win. I don't
        suggest bribery and corruption, but certain things not
        immoral, though perhaps illegal, must be done. That is why
        I once suggested to you that someone from here should have
        an interview with some friend who might represent you. You
        did not respond to this. You do not appear willing to be
        guided by your Committee even in the expenditure of £15 for
        chairs and tables for your new Committee-room; and I must
        repeat that such excessive caution will not be followed by
        success. You will only waste your time, and the Party here
        will be defeated. If you do not feel willing to be guided
        by the old Leaders of the Party here, who know what is
        needed, far better reconsider your position, and resign
        while there is yet time.</p>

        <p>Now, in addition to your <i>legal election expenses</i>
        (between £500 and £600), there will be the Registration
        which, however, is a permissible payment. But, above all,
        railway fares, conveyances, and sundry other expenses which
        are forbidden by the Act, must be met by your friends, or
        success is hopeless. Young HARRISON is standing at
        Chursfield. His father intends him to win, and he will see
        to the needful!! That is the way to work it, and to win.
        You must be prepared to pay at least £150 (or to get
        someone to pay it for you) <i>for sundries</i>. Even thus
        your expenditure will not reach £1000; dirt cheap for a
        safe borough. Formerly a borough contest used to mean
        £3,000, and a county anything up to £50,000!</p>

    <p>What an old rascal! I answered very shortly, merely stating
    my intention of coming to Billsbury on the 16th, in order to
    interview the Committee. I must nip all this in the bud, or
    chuck the whole business.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, May 16th, "George Hotel,"
    Billsbury.</i>&mdash;Came down to Billsbury this afternoon. Had
    interview with a delegation from the Committee in the Hotel.
    MOFFAT, BLISSOP, and JERRAM were there. They laid their views
    before me. Much the same as VULLIAMY's letter. "Shame to wreck
    the ship for want of a ha'porth of tar," said BLISSOP.
    "Gentlemen," I said, "if you think I'm going to handle any of
    this tar, or do any dirty work, you are mistaken. I am willing
    to help in the Registration and to pay proper subscriptions,
    but I won't budge a step outside the Corrupt Practices Act, so
    far as my election expenses are concerned. If you want someone
    who will make illegal payments, go somewhere else. I'm quite
    willing to resign. Now you know my opinion, and I leave you to
    confer with your colleagues." With that I left them. Met them
    again two hours later. All three looking thoroughly ashamed of
    themselves. Said they had reconsidered the matter, and begged
    me to think no more about it. They were determined, they said,
    to use only legal means in fighting the election. So that blew
    over. Afterwards each of them came to me in private, to beg my
    pardon, and put the fault on the others. MOFFAT said it was
    BLISSOP, BLISSOP declared it was JERRAM, and JERRAM swore that
    such a thing would never have entered his mind if MOFFAT hadn't
    insisted on it.</p>

    <p>Wrote to VULLIAMY that I found he had entirely misjudged the
    local feeling, and that, in any case, his suggestions were
    quite impracticable. He'll detest me, but I don't care a brass
    farthing.</p>

    <h2>ROBERT AT THE ACADEMY.</h2>

    <p>Witsuntide being a rayther slack time with us Hed Waiters,
    coz our principle paytrons is all out of Town, I naterally
    slected that week for my annewal yearly wisit to the Royal
    Academy. I never coud quite hunderstand why it was called a
    Academy, which I bleeves is a rayther swell name for a Skool,
    but I hadn't bin there long larst week afore I soon dishcovered
    the reason. In course it stands to reason that lots of the
    werry wust of the bad picturs is the work of werry young
    pupils, who haven't yet left skool, so that's why they calls it
    a Academy insted of a Hinstitooshun or a Hexebishun.</p>

    <p>The fust thing as struck me wos the emense number of
    portraits of peeple as noboddy never heard of, and therefore
    didn't want for to see, and I wunders how the poor peeple woud
    like for to be obliged to wark about the rooms and hear the fun
    as the peeple makes on 'em. One on 'em looks so werry cross,
    that a Gent by me said as how he must ha' bin taken when the
    bad news came from India. Another looks so savage, that amost
    everybody asks him why he don't have it out and done with it!
    Another werry savage sojer looked at me as much as to say,
    "What are you staring at, Stupid?" which wasn't at all perlite.
    Professor HUXLEY, I am told, is a werry great man, and so he
    most suttenly seems for to think by the looks on him, and ain't
    he jist got a lot of big books for to read! I was surprised to
    find as there wasn't not no Lord Mare among the lot. His
    Lordship's state robes wood have lighted up the hole place. And
    now for the reel picters.</p>

    <p>Fust and foremost of all the lot stands "<i>The Flock of
    Sheep</i>," by Mr. COOPER, and as this happens to be one of the
    things as I does understand, I makes no hesitation in saying,
    that there's about a dozen of the werry finest saddles of
    mutton there as I ewer seed, ewen at the honored Manshun House!
    Next comes the grand pictur called "<i>One and Twenty</i>." Ah!
    ain't they jest a jolly set, and ain't they all a drinking the
    young swell's health, and manny appy returns of the day? Why
    you can amost hear 'em.</p>

    <p>And now jest a word and a hint to all our great Painters.
    Pray what is picters painted for? Is it to make peeple werry
    sollem, and werry sorry, and werry unappy? Ain't we got reel
    trubbles, and reel sorrows enuff in the world, without painting
    sham ones? And yet I do declare that, arter looking at them two
    wundurful picters of "<i>The Crisis</i>," and "<i>The
    Doctor</i>," and feeling as there wasn't not no chance for
    either of the poor things to recover, that the kind Doctor's
    trubble was all in wain, and that the poor Mother wood soon
    have to bear the awfullest trubble as she coud ewer know, I
    left the place as fast as I coud get out, for fear the peeple
    shoud notice the big round tears as woud run down my silly old
    cheeks. Oh, Mr. FILDES, Mr. FILDES, to think that jest a few
    little delicate touches of your magic brush woud have sent away
    thousands of appy hearts, instead of hundreds of miserable
    ones, ort to make you resolve always to put jest a gleam of
    hope in your wunderful pictures in future.</p>

    <p>There was about the same number of staggerers as ushal, and
    I again arsks, who has the hordacity to buy 'em? I wunder what
    Mrs. ROBERT woud say if I took one home to my sober dwelling!
    But, jest as I was a coming away, I seed one of the most
    howdacions of the lot, and it was named "<i>The Judgment of
    Paris"!</i> I had often heard as the French was werry free and
    bold in all these sort of things, but I newer coud have thort
    that our Royal Academy swells coud have so lowered theirselves
    as to condescend to submit the whole of the Picters in the
    Exhibition to the judgment of the Paris Painters, or that they
    wood have slected the greatest staggerer as the one in their
    judgment the most worthy of the werry fust prize. I don't think
    as it says much for their taste.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Thursday, May 21.</i>&mdash;House
    resumed to-day, after so-called Whitsun holidays. Weren't to
    have come back till Monday. OLD MORALITY settled that before he
    went off to Southern climes. But next day WINDBAG SEXTON and
    JOKIM got to loggerheads. WINDBAG insisted that Committee
    should specially sit to hear him move new Clause. JOKIM
    demurred; pointed out that luxury might be enjoyed by House
    only upon condition of shortening holidays. WINDBAG didn't see
    any objection to that; sure House only too glad to give up half
    its holiday in order to hear few more speeches from him. JOKIM,
    meaning to frighten WINDBAG, said, "Very well; then we'll
    adjourn till Thursday." WINDBAG, not believing JOKIM was
    serious, said he didn't care; game of bluff commenced; played
    so awkwardly that, in end, House jockeyed out of half its
    holiday.</p>

             for Influenza.
    </div>

    <p>But OLD MORALITY got all his; off before this blundering
    business took place; too far gone to be called back.
    CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN suggests that we shall change his name; call
    him "The JUDICIOUS HOOKER." Certainly he "hooked it" a day
    before holidays commenced, and won't return till several days
    after they have prematurely closed. Still remnant of House here
    to-night, though growling and discontented, does not grudge him
    his holiday.</p>

    <p>More than half Members on both sides away ill. The Whips
    severely hit; MARJORIBANKS here as usual, making a bright space
    in the lobby with his genial presence and his smiling
    countenance. But AKERS-DOUGLAS still away with most of his men,
    including the Mountainous HILL.</p>

    <p>"Yes," his man is reported to have said, in reply to
    inquiries, "Lord ARTHUR is still HILL, but gettin' better."</p>

    </div>

    <p>Only cheerful man on the premises is PLUNKET. Beaming with
    health; glowing with vitality.</p>

    <p>"The secret of it?" he said, when I asked him how he managed
    to look so well. "Why, it's exercise and fumigation. Whilst you
    fellows have been making holiday, I've stuck to the House night
    and day. I've fumigated every chamber with sulphur; I've
    sprinkled every wall with eucalyptozone. The tiled floors I
    have washed with carbolic-soap, and the libraries I have
    purified with Thiocamp. It was a little stiff at first; but, as
    Mr. G. says, there's no rest like variety of occupation. When I
    got tired of Eucalyptozone, I turned to with Thiocamp, and then
    went through a course of taking up carpets and thumping
    hair-cushions. Quite sorry it's over."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Land Purchase
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;"Do you like IBSEN?" ATTORNEY-GENERAL
    for IRELAND asked Prince ARTHUR just now, <i>à propos</i> of
    new Clause moved by SEXTON.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Curious man is MADDEN. Lives a sort of dual life. In House
    regarded as serious person, steeped in knowledge of Irish
    Question in its multiform aspects. Really a
    <i>fin-de-siècle</i> Attorney-General; knows everything; is in
    everything; acquainted with IBSEN, misses few bazaars or
    drawing-room concerts, and was on speaking terms with the late
    Madame BLAVATSKY.</p>

    <p>"Do you like <i>Hedda Gabler</i>?" he continued, nudging
    Prince ARTHUR, who on this, the hundred-and-third night in
    Committee on the Irish Land Bill, showed signs of
    drowsiness.</p>

    <p>"Haven't time to go to the theatre," said Prince ARTHUR.
    "Never perform out of Westminster, where we keep our own
    HEADACHE GABBLER on the premises"; and he looked wearily across
    at SEXTON monotonously piping, not without dread suspicion of
    the WINDBAG having been newly leathered.</p>

    <p>But the end comes to the man who lives to wait, and
    to-night, at twenty minutes past ten, LEWIS PELLY sitting bolt
    upright, awakened out of peaceful slumber by a sudden cheer;
    knew that the Land Bill was at last through Committee.</p>

    <h2>NOTES ON THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF 2091.</h2>

    <p>"<i>Richard, Duke of Gloucester, refusing the Crown</i>."
    This picture will be interesting to the historical student, as
    it affords a solution to a knotty point that has puzzled
    commentators for the last five centuries. The wily humpback is
    represented in his dressing-gown and slippers, having evidently
    been called from his bath to listen to the suggestion of the
    courtiers, who desire him to accept the regal dignity. The
    umbrella of the Lord Mayor, we fancy, is of a later date than
    the supposed period of the painting, but no doubt the artist
    has authority for the introduction of the quaint old lamp-post
    illumined with the electric light, which began to be used some
    little time after the Battle of the Roses.</p>

    <p>"<i>Charles the Second in the Oak</i>." This is also
    interesting to those who delight in folklore. According to the
    legend (for no doubt the story was merely a legend), the
    deposed monarch was escaping from the Parliamentary troops,
    when he had to seek shelter in the spreading branches of the
    tree that still is emblematic of England. The artist has placed
    the leafy refuge near a stream, where CHARLES seems to have
    been bathing. A tragic side (not entirely free from quaintness)
    is given to the tale by the discovery of the temporarily
    discarded wearing apparel of the STUART by the soldiers, who
    are hunting him to the death. CHARLES, with his traditional
    good humour, is smiling at an accident which causes him
    seemingly more amusement than apprehension.</p>

    <p>"<i>The Battle of Trafalgar</i>." The very clever
    arrangement of smoke in this painting prevents the flesh-tints
    of the sailors from assuming a prominence that might be
    objectionable to persons of fastidious tastes. No doubt the
    artist felt that, if he had studied the traditions of the
    British Navy at the commencement of the nineteenth or twentieth
    century (the battle was fought in that period), he would have
    shown the gallant tars serving the guns in a costume not more
    elaborate than that assumed by the nude inhabitants of the
    North Pole. It is amusing to note in this connection that,
    until the discovery of the summit of the earth, it was supposed
    that the centre of the Arctic Regions was bitterly cold. Our
    ancestors in the remote ages had no idea that that fiery region
    was, in reality, hotter than the tropics!</p>

        <p>"Why, off for MY Bank Holiday, to be sure!"</p>
    </div>

    <p>"<i>Portrait of an English Gentleman of the Nineteenth
    Century</i>."&mdash;We are not quite sure that we like the
    unconventional treatment of the accessories in this picture. It
    is perfectly true that we find from contemporary records that
    an invitation to dinner was frequently accompanied by the
    expressed wish that the guest "was not to dress;" but still
    such hints at the strange manners and customs of a bygone age
    may be carried out too literally.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
